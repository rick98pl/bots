## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Safety Notes

- **Use at Your Own Risk**: Botting violates Tibia's rules and may result in your account being banned
- **Start Small**: When testing, use short paths and supervised operation before extended use
- **Test in Safe Areas**: Initially test in safer hunting grounds with fewer players
- **Active Monitoring**: Do not leave the bot completely unattended
- **Account Security**: Never share your credentials or bot settings with others

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Memory Reading Errors**: Restart the bot after client updates
- **Path Playback Issues**: Make sure the bot is using the correct waypoints file
- **Click Recognition Problems**: Adjust the UI position variables for your screen resolution
- **Spawn Detection Not Working**: Check image templates are clear and properly sized
- **Performance Issues**: Try disabling click overlay to reduce CPU usage

### Config Adjustments
- Adjust `DEFAULT_HP_THRESHOLD` for health potion usage point
- Adjust `DEFAULT_MANA_THRESHOLD` for mana potion usage point
- Modify `statsOverlayRightOffset` and `statsOverlayBottomOffset` to position the overlay correctly
- Set `lootMatchThreshold` value to adjust item recognition sensitivity

## üõ† Development

The bot is written in C# and uses several key libraries:
- **System.Diagnostics**: For process management
- **System.Runtime.InteropServices**: For Win32 API calls
- **System.Drawing**: For UI and visuals
- **Emgu CV**: For computer vision and image recognition

Key components:
- Memory reading for game state
- Windows message system for input simulation
- Template matching for object recognition
- Path finding and movement logic
